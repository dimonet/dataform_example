#### _The instruction describes how the Docker is instaled and configurated in the WSL tool (Ubuntu) without Docker Desktop._ 
https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/install-docker-in-wsl-2-without-docker-desktop 

### Activate Hyper-V in the Windows on a local PC
1. Win+R 
2. Type "optionalfeatures" in the search box
3. Turn On "Hyper-V" checkbox

### Install and configure WSL on a local PC
1. Instal WSL on a local PC (Windows PowerShell by Administrator)
    ```shell
    wsl --install -d ubuntu
    ```
2. Edit etc/sudoers to password entering disable
    ```shell
    sudo nano /etc/sudoers
    ```
    Add the next string at the end of the config file:   
    `dbuza ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` 

### Install and configure Docker in the WSL
1. Uninstall Docker Desktop  
   On my machine it added these 2 files in ~/.docker within my WSL 2 instance:
   ```
   lrwxrwxrwx  1 nick nick   30 Sep 16  2020 contexts -> /c/Users/Nick/.docker/contexts
   lrwxrwxrwx  1 nick nick   35 Aug 21 17:24 features.json -> /c/Users/Nick/.docker/features.json
   ```
   Uninstalling Docker Desktop will not remove those Windows paths so things will technically still work but if you ever delete them later youâ€™ll end getting Docker endpoint for "default" not found errors when you try to run most Docker commands within WSL 2 since the symlinks will have no destination.

2. Install Docker / Docker Compose v2 in WSL 2
   1. Install Docker, you can ignore the warning from Docker about using WSL
      ```shell
      curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
      ```
      ```shell
      sudo sh get-docker.sh
      ```
   2. Add your user to the Docker group
      ```shell
      sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
      ```
   3. Sanity check that both tools were installed successfully
      ```shell
      docker --version
      ```
      ```shell
      docker compose version
      ```
3. Set iptables compatibility
   ```shel
   sudo update-alternatives --config iptables
   ```
   select iptables-legacy

4. Edit ~/.profile to docker auto run
   ```shell
   nano ~/.profile
   ```
    Add the next string at the end of the config file:      
   ```
   # Start Docker (if not already running)
   if grep -q "microsoft" /proc/version > /dev/null 2>&1; then
       if service docker status 2>&1 | grep -q "is not running"; then
           wsl.exe --distribution "${WSL_DISTRO_NAME}" --user root \
               --exec /usr/sbin/service docker start > /dev/null 2>&1
       fi
   fi
   ```
5. Check that Docker daemon running
   ```shell
   ps aux | grep docker
   ```

6. Test docker after cloasing current and opening a new terminal
   ```shell
   docker run hello-world
   ```
